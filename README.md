End to end native Swift and Apple Watch app for Lightning Realty demo application for Salesforce App Cloud. This app is for the realtors to keep up to date on likes per property, and pre-approvals per customer (lead).

The app relies on [HomeSwiper](https://github.com/quintonwall/HouseSwiper) and the [Leads Embeddable SDK](https://github.com/quintonwall/leads-sdk) to allow customers to submit interest in a property.
